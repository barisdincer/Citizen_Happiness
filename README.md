-   Describe the problem you investigate in your data set.

Happiness is considered an important element of human life and affects people's overall well-being and quality of life. However, the factors that influence happiness can be complex and may differ in different countries. The problem of this dataset is to identify the factors that affect happiness.

-   Provide some background on your data set

The data set used for this analysis is based on the World Happiness Report, an annual publication that assesses the happiness levels and well-being of people in various countries. The data set includes information from the years 2019. The Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) performed a thorough investigation known as the World Happiness Report in association with other experts and researchers. It takes into account multiple factors that contribute to happiness and well-being, including economic indicators, social support systems, health measures, freedom of choice, generosity, and perceptions of corruption. The dataset attempts to offer a thorough knowledge of happiness levels throughout the world and the variables affecting happiness.

-   State the main problem and research objectives that you want to accomplish

The main issue with this research is figuring out what influences happiness levels in various nations. Additionally, it can support politicians in their decision-making to advance social welfare.

*Research Objectives*

Determine the general levels of happiness in various nations: The research aims to ascertain the general levels of happiness in various nations by examining the happiness scores offered in the data set. This objective will provide an overview of the general happiness distribution across countries.

Investigating variables that are significantly associated with happiness: This study aims to pinpoint the variables that are significantly associated with happiness. The study aims to identify the most important factors that influence happiness by looking at factors like GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life decisions, generosity, and perceptions of corruption.

Examining the impact of GDP per capita on happiness: Determining the connection between GDP per capita and happiness is one specific goal. The goal of the research is to ascertain whether greater levels of economic prosperity---as indicated by GDP per capita---have a significant effect on happiness levels by conducting a data analysis.

## Methodology

Briefly describe the statistical modeling you will employ to analyze the data.

-   Why it is suitable for your design?

In order to understand the relationship between the dependent variable and independent variables in my variables, I chose the regression analysis technique among the statistical modeling options.

I think there might be a connection between the independent variables and the dependent variable in my data, which is the happiness score. The happiness index is a crucial indicator of a nation's wealth and the standard of living of its people. Therefore, for the purposes of my project, it is crucial to comprehend the variables that affect the happiness score.

Regression analysis is a technique used to model the linear relationship between the dependent variable and independent variables. In this kind of analysis, the influence of independent variables on the value of the dependent variable is determined. In this instance, I want to examine the effects of other variables (GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, perception of corruption) on the happiness score using the happiness score as the dependent variable.

Regression analysis can be used in a variety of situations, which is another benefit. The technique of regression analysis is widely used in a variety of disciplines, including the social sciences, economics, marketing research, and health analysis. Regression analysis makes sense, therefore, to comprehend the relationship between the variables in my data.

-   The main equations and properties can be summarized before going further on modeling.

I will apply regression analysis to estimate the coefficients of the independent variables that best predict the value of the dependent variable.

PCA is used to reduce multidimensional datasets to fewer dimensions and to understand the structure of variability in the dataset. There are few rows in the dataset. So I'm not going to apply PCA and I don't have dimensionality reduction problems.
